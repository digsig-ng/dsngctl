dsngctl - Control utility for DigSig-ng (digsig-ng.org)
=======================================================

Introduction
------------

dsngctl is a userspace command line utility accompaning the DigSig-ng kernel
module, as part of the DigSig-ng project hosted at digsig-ng.org.

The purpose of the dsngctl command is to provide an easy frontend to issue
commands to the kernel module.

Getting Started
---------------

The `start` command is the most important command of the tool: it is
responsible for loading GnuPG pubilc keys to the private module.

Firstly, you need to export your GnuPG public key used for signing the system
executables. This can be accomplished using the following command:

    gpg --export >> my_public_key.pub

You can then use the `dsngctl start` command to load the public key, as
follows:

    dsngctl start my_public_key.pub

You may wish to write an init script appopriate to your Linux distribution to
automatically load a key on boot.

You can use the `dsngctl status` command to check the current status of the
module: whether the module is present and whether a key has already been
provided.
